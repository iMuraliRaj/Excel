There are 14 ways to add serial numbers

1. Row Numbers as Serial Numbers

        By default, in a spreadsheet, you have row numbers which act as a serial number for the data.
        
        If you don’t want to use serial numbers for filtering or any other purpose then it’s better to use the row headers.
        

2. Draging the serial number column

        Enter the number in first row
        
        Drag the column to wherever we want to stop the serial number
        
3. Fill Series To Automatically Add Serial Numbers       

        Now let’s say you want to automatically number rows up to 10000 or 100000 and you want to do this in a one go.

        Maybe it’s a pain with fill handle but, you can use fill series to generate a column with serial numbers in a one go.

        Here are the steps.

        Select the cell from where you want to start your serial numbers and insert “1” in it.
        Now, go to home tab ➜ editing ➜ fill ➜ series.
        In the series window, do the following.
        Series In = Column.
        Step Value = 1
        Stop Value = 10000 or whatever you want up to.
        Click OK.
        
        
4. Use ROW Function to Drag Serial Numbers
        ROW is an effective way to insert serial numbers in your worksheet. 

It can return the row number of a reference and when you skip referring to any cell it will return the row number of cell in which you have entered it.

Here's the simple steps.

Go to cell A1 and enter the =ROW() formula in it.
Now drag the formula to down, up to the serial number you want.
