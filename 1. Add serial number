There are 14 ways to add serial numbers

1. Row Numbers as Serial Numbers

        By default, in a spreadsheet, you have row numbers which act as a serial number for the data.
        
        If you don’t want to use serial numbers for filtering or any other purpose then it’s better to use the row headers.
        

2. Draging the serial number column

        Enter the number in first row
        
        Drag the column to wherever we want to stop the serial number
